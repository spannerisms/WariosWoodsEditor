# Wario's Woods SNES Editor

This is a public alpha application for editing *Wario's Woods* on the SNES.

This is very bare-bones and limited in functionality. Currently, it only supports editing Round Game. Because of how level data is rewritten, any ROM saved by this program will have problems if any of the other modes are played.

I don't know how far I'll go with this application, because I don't expect to see significant interest from anyone.
